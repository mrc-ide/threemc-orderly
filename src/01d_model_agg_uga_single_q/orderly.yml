  - Fit model and perform aggregations while removing the most recent survey 
  from the data. The aim is to perform an out-of-sample validation, whereby we 
  seek to ascertain whether our modelled uncertainty bounds contains the last 
  survey recorded, which has been masked from our model fitting procedure.
